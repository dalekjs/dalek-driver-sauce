## Docs

This module is a driver plugin for [DalekJS](//github.com/dalekjs/dalek).
It connects Daleks testsuite with the remote testing environment of [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com).

The driver can be installed with the following command:

```
$ npm install dalek-driver-sauce --save-dev
```

You can use the driver by adding a config option to the your [Dalekfile](http://dalekjs.com/docs/config.html)

```js
"driver": ["sauce"]
```

Or you can tell Dalek that it should run your tests via sauces service via the command line:

```
$ dalek mytest.js -d sauce
```

In order to run your tests within the Sauce Labs infrastructure, you must add your sauce username & key 
to your dalek configuration. Those two parameters must be set in order to get this driver up & running.
You can specifiy them within your [Dalekfile](http://dalekjs.com/docs/config.html) like so:

```js
"driver.sauce": {
  "user": "dalekjs",
  "key": "aaaaaa-1234-567a-1abc-1br6d9f68689"
}
```

It is also possible to specify a set of other extra saucy parameters like `name` & `tags`:

```js
"driver.sauce": {
  "user": "dalekjs",
  "key": "aaaaaa-1234-567a-1abc-1br6d9f68689",
  "name": "Guineapig",
  "tags": ["dalek", "testproject"]
}
```

If you would like to have a more control over the browser/OS combinations that are available, you are able 
to configure you custom combinations:

```js
"browsers": [{
  "chrome": {
    "platform": "OS X 10.6",
    "actAs": "chrome",
    "version": 27
  },
  "chromeWin": {
    "platform": "Windows 7",
    "actAs": "chrome",
    "version": 27
  },
  "chromeLinux": {
    "platform": "Linux",
    "actAs": "chrome",
    "version": 26
  }
```

You can then call your custom browsers like so:

```
$ dalek mytest.js -d sauce -b chrome,chromeWin,chromeLinux
```

or you can define them in your Dalekfile:

```js
"browser": ["chrome", "chromeWin", "chromeLinux"]
```

A list of all available browser/OS combinations, can be found [here](https://saucelabs.com/docs/platforms).
